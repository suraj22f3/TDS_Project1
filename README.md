- How I scraped the data:
  - Using the GitHub API, I retrieved data for Chennai users with 50+ followers, saved their details, and extracted their 500 recent repository information. I then compiled this into CSV files for analysis.
- An Interesting Fact on my analysis:
  - There are 132 unique languages (Programming, Scripting,Markup,etc..).
- A small piece of Recommendation:
  - Stay Updated with Java!
  - While it has seen a decline in usage in projects from 11.31%(till 2020) to 4.79%(after 2020), Java remains a strong foundational language.
  - Keeping it in your skillset can benefit you in many enterprise and backend systems.
